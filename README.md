## How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with 
different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very
simple: open two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

* The player opens one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then opens a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol       and that will be counted as one move.
* If the cards match, both cards stay opened.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are closed again.

The stars rating depends on the number of moves:
*  :star::star::star::star::star: If the moves  are between o and 17.
* :star::star::star::star: If the moves  are between 17 and 27.
* :star::star::star: If the moves  between 27 and 37.
* :star::star: If the moves  between 37 and 47.
* :star: If the moves  47 or more .



The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
The player could restart the game at any time by clicking on the restart icon.
